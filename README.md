# SwipeControls

Swipe Controls display an overlay when the user touches the control. By moving his or her finger (panning) the user can then perform different tasks such as selecting a menu item or changing the value of a volume slider.

**It is recommended to use the swipe slider only as a shortcut and to display a full-featured popover if the user taps the control!** 
For example the audio volume can be quickly adjusted using the swipe-slider. For precise control or AirPlay-configuration a popover with a `MPVolumeView` is displayed.


## Swipe Slider

EKSwipeSlider provides a slider similar to `UISlider`.  When the overlay is displayed, the it is moved on the x-axis to the left or right depending on the value of the slider.

_The slider adjusts its position depending on the initial value when touched. The orange point represents the touch point._
