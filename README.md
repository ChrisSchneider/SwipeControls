# SwipeControls

Swipe Controls display an overlay when the user touches the control. By moving his or her finger (panning) the user can then perform different tasks such as selecting a menu item or changing the value of a volume slider.

**It is recommended to use the swipe slider only as a shortcut and to display a full-featured popover if the user taps the control!** 
For example the audio volume can be quickly adjusted using the swipe-slider. For precise control or AirPlay-configuration a popover with a `MPVolumeView` is displayed.


## Swipe Slider

![Example](http://i50.tinypic.com/2rdusqr.png)

EKSwipeSlider provides a slider similar to `UISlider`.  When the overlay is displayed, it is moved on the x-axis to the left or right depending on the value of the slider.

When displayed the slider adjusts its position depending on the value. The orange points represent the touch points.
